That's great to hear! Using -e data.len instead of -e frame.len targets the data payload length of the packets, which aligns more closely with your encoding scheme where the ICMP payload size reflects the ASCII values. This change effectively captures the specific portion of the packet you're interested in for decoding, making the script work as intended. If there's anything more you'd like to explore or any further adjustments needed, feel free to ask!
